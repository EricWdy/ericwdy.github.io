Hi I'm Eric learning JS. This is my portfolio.

## About this repo

The repo contains my projects in the MIT coding professional program, so the repo will be updated from time to time. Hope you like them.

## The MIT Coding Professional Program

Organized by MIT xPro and Emeritus and lasting for about ten months, the program aims to provide training on MERN development in Javascript. Both the instructors are professors from MIT.
