# Eyes
<img src="eyes.gif" width=400 />
An interesting front-end mouse-movement triggered animation. The eyeballs will follow your cursor wherever you point it to (but will not go out of sight!).

## How to run it:
1. Open index.html. You should see a pair of eyes in the middle of the page;
2. Move the cursor. Now you can see the eyes are tracking your mouse movement!

## Future improvement to be made:
Maybe I will add a mouse-click event listener, so that on clicks the eyes can close and reopen!
